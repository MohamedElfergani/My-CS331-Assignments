Java Application Required scenarios and Query sets 
 
Your team will be responsible to complete the implementation and demonstrate the 
application behavior for the following 3 Scenarios functionalities in the 
application. 
 
Please Note: For the application UI, I will not include complete screenshots here as I want each 
group to think how they want to present their application. Main screen UI Sample is provided as 
well as some others

1. Equipment & Supplies 
2. Customers & Services  
3. Employees 
4. Updates 
5. Quit 
Type in your option: 4

Scenario 1  
In Figure 1: Option 4 is used for database administrative functions. When the user chooses option 4 
(Updates) from the Main Menu interface “Figure 1’: The user should be prompted to enter the admin 
login information username and password. The application verifies the information and if correct, that 
means this person is an admin and he/she is authorized to do updates on the database. 
If the username or password is incorrect the user will be prompted to try again with valid admin login info 
or quit to the main screen. 
 
Once the user successfully logs in it will show a new UI with the options below: 
1. Option A: Insert new information which includes 4 new sub options 
• Add new equipment 
• Add a new service 
• Add new customer information 
• Add new employee information 
 
2. Option B: Delete some information which includes 4 new sub options 
• Delete specific equipment 
• Delete a specific service 
• Delete specific customer information 
 2 
• Delete specific employee information 
 
3. Option C: Update current information which includes 4 new sub options 
• Update specific equipment 
• Update a specific service 
• Update specific customer information 
• Update specific employee information 
 
For this Scenario, the team is responsible to implement and demonstrate the functionality for only 
Option B (Delete some information) and for all the 4 sub options. The video recording should show 
how the application can be used to delete one example of each sub option under option B.

Figure 2: Customers & Services 
 
When the user chooses option 2 (Customers & Services) from the Main Menu interface “Figure 1’, it 
will show a new UI similar to Figure 2. 
 
Implement and demonstrate the application behavior for the following options in Figure 2 
 
1. When the user chooses option 1(Analyze the progress of the business) from the interface in 
Figure 2, it should take you to new UI interface that gives the options to retrieve the following: 
a. Option A (Total number of new customers): It should present the total number of new 
customers during the current year.

provided to customers. Group this information by service type.  
 
3. When the user chooses option 3 (Customers) from the main interface it should take you to a new 
UI interface that gives the option to retrieve the following 
a. Option A (Customer list for a service) It should prompt for the name of a service and 
returns a list of customers that used it.  
b. Option B (Customer number): It should present the total number of customers per month 
during the year. The application prompts for the year data.
